# This, is microq

microq is a tiny MQTT broker written in Go.
It is inspired by several mature messaging systems such as NATS, Kafka, ActiveMQ etc.

## Vision

#### Messaging should be easy
Developers should be able to onboard microq and start writing code without the
need to unlearn their current messaging experience.
microq will be cloud compatible, but you don't need to have Kubernetes running.
You will be able to run microq anywhere from a Raspberry Pi, to a traditional Linux Desktop,
a gigantic public cloud machine, an IBM-Z server, and of course, Kubernetes.

#### Messaging should be based on open standards
When messaging systems are built on open standards, it grows the ecosystem instead of dividing it. microq will always be based on multiple open standards and transports.


#### Knowledge is best when shared
There will never be an *enterprise*, or *premium* flavor of microq.
